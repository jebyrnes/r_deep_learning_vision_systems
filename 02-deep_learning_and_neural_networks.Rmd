# Deep Learning and Neural Networks

## Fully Connected layers
### Box on Page 48

An exercise to build a network and see what is inside!

```{r first_network, warning=FALSE}
library(keras)
library(tensorflow)

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 5, input_shape = 4) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 5) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 3)
```

Now, what's in the box?

```{r first_network_summary}
summary(model)
```
