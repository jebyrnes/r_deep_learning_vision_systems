</center>

This is an attempt to translate [Deep Learning for Vision Systems](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-for-vision-systems) by Mohamed Elgendy into R code using the keras and tensorflow library in order for R users who are not familiar with python to run code from the book.

## Prerequisites to run this code {-}

To run the code in this bookdown, please install the following packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("keras")
install.packages("tensorflow")
```

I hope you find this usefu!
