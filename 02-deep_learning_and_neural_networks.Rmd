# Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Definitely go check out https://playground.tensorflow.org/ and play around - it's a great learning tool!

## Fully Connected layers
### Box on Page 48

An exercise to build a network and see what is inside!

```{r first_network, warning=FALSE}
library(keras)
library(tensorflow)

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>%
  layer_dense(units = 5, input_shape = 4) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 5) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 3)
```

Now, what's in the box?

```{r first_network_summary}
summary(model)
```

## 2.3.6 The Relu Function 

Just a quick implementation

```{r relu}
relu <- function(x){
  if(x < 0) return(0)
  return(x)
}

#for example
relu(-5)

relu(3)
```

## 2.3.7 Leaky Relu
I couldn't resist improving a bit here

```{r leaky_relu}
leaky_relu <- function(x, leak = 0.01){
    if(x < 0) return(leak*x)
  return(x)
}

#for example
leaky_relu(-5)

relu(3)
```
